#moment-countdown

moment-countdown is a tiny [moment.js](http://momentjs.com) plugin that integrates with [Countdown.js](http://coundownjs.org). The file is [here](https://raw.github.com/icambron/master/bin/moment-countdown-min.js). The NPM is `moment-countdown`.

##How it works

```js
//from then until now
moment("1982-5-25").countdown().toString(); //=> '30 years, 10 months, 14 days, 1 hour, 8 minutes, and 14 seconds'

//accepts a moment, JS Date, or anything parsable by the Date constructor
moment("1955-8-21").countdown("1982-5-25").toString(); //=> '26 years, 9 months, and 4 days'

//also works with the args flipped, like diff()
moment("1982-5-25").countdown("1955-8-21").toString(); //=> '26 years, 9 months, and 4 days'

//accepts all of countdown's options
moment().countdown("1982-5-25", countdown.MONTHS|countdown.WEEKS, NaN, 2).toString(); //=> '370 months, and 2.01 weeks'
```

See [Countdown's documentation](http://countdownjs.org/readme.html) for descriptions of those extra options.

##Twix integration
If you're using [Twix.js](http://icambron.github.io/twix.js), you can also use `countdown` on Twix ranges:

```js
moment().twix("1982-5-25").countdown(countdown.DAYS|countdown.MINUTES).toString(); //=> '11276 days, and 87 minutes'
```

##Getting set up

###Browser
Grab [moment.js](https://raw.github.com/timrwood/moment/2.0.0/min/moment.min.js), [countdown.js](https://bitbucket.org/mckamey/countdown.js/raw/tip/countdown.min.js), and [moment-countdown.js](https://raw.github.com/icambron/master/bin/moment-countdown-min.js). Then inside your header:

```html
<script src="moment.min.js"></script>
<script src="countdown.min.js"></script>
<script src="moment-countdown.min.js"></script>
```

And you're off the races. If you're also using Twix, include it after moment but before moment-countdown.

###Node

```
npm install moment-countdown
```

You should also have Moment and Countdown installed, which you do like this: 

```
npm install moment countdown
```

In your node code:

```js
require('moment-countdown');
```
